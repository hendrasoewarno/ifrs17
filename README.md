## Recognition
There is no limit to grouping a portfolio of insurance contracts issued by an entity, however, the minimum portfolio division,
(PSAK No. 74, paragraph 16):
a) Loss of contract group (onerous) at initial recognition.
b) The group of contracts upon initial recognition does not have a significant
probability of becoming a loss contract.
c) The remaining group of contracts in the portfolio.

## Measurement Model
On initial measurement An entity should recognise a group of insurance contracts it issues from the earliest of the following:(1)the beginning of the coverage period of the group of contracts; (2) date when the first payment from a policyholder in the group is due or when the first payment is received if there is no due date,(3) for a group of onerous contracts, when the group becomes onerous.

There are three (3) types of measurement models in calculating insurance liability based on PSAK No.74 (IFRS 17), such as:

### Building Block Model (General Measurement Model “GMM”).
The general model measures a group of insurance contracts as the sum of the  following components, or ‘building blocks’, for each group of insurance contract. The initially measured GMM explained in the following formula:

PV of Futures Cash Flow (BEL) + Risk Adjustment +Unearned Profit = IFRS 17 Asset or Liability

#### FulFilment Cash Flow = PV of Futures Cash Flow (BEL) + Risk Adjusment
The fulfilment cash flows are the current estimates of the amounts that an insurer expects to collect from premiums and pay out for claims, benefits and expenses, adjusted to reflect the timing and the uncertainty in those amounts The adjustment
for uncertainty is called the risk adjustment.

#### CSM = Unearned Profit
The contractual service margin represents the profit that the entity expects to earn as it provides insurance coverage. This profit is recognised in profit or loss over the coverage period as the company provides the insurance coverage.
At initial recognition of the contracts, the contractual service margin is the present value of risk-adjusted future cash inflows less the present value of risk‑adjusted future cash outflows. If contracts are onerous, losses are recognized immediately in profit or loss. No contractual service margin is recognised on the balance sheet on initial recognition.

On subsequent measurement, the fulfilment cash flows are measured using current assumptions which is updated at each reporting date, using current estimates of the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows and of discount rates.The way in
which changes in estimates of the fulfilment cash flows are treated depends on which estimate is being updated:(a) changes that relate to current or past coverage are recognised in profit or loss. (b) changes that relate to future coverage are
recognised by adjusting the contractual service margin.

### Premium Allocation Approach (PPA)
PPA measurement method can be used by entities that have insurance contracts with insurance coverage of less than 1 (one) year. The use of the PPA measurement method for insurance contracts with a coverage period of more than 1 (one) year
can only be chosen by the entity if the results of the eligibility test using GMM are not significantly different. Usually this measurement model is used for general insurance.

### Variable Fee Approach (VFA)
VFA is used when payments to policyholders depend on the performance of certain assets (direct participation features) such as unit links in life insurance.
